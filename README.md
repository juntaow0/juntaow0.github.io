## Games I made for fun or for school projects

- [FPS Demo](https://juntaow0.github.io/Unity_FPS_Dev_Build/)
  - A FPS demo scene I made to play around with Unity and learn about building a FPS system. It is heavily influence by Counter-Strike.
- [Orgas Great Escape](https://juntaow0.github.io/OrgasGreatEscape/)

  - A 2D space game I made while learning about WebGL. 
- [WebGL Ray Traced Chess Scene](https://juntaow0.github.io/WebGL_Ray_Traced_Chess_Scene/)
